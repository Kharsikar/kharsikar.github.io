<p style="text-align:center">Excitingly working on a new mini personal project. I am pretty nuts about gaming in my spare time and what a better way to showcase this and make a website that will feed in my gaming social accounts and games I am interested in.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Currently it is only in landing page template and not ready to upload but to get a taste of the design of the site I have uploaded a screenshot. This is a homage to Blade Runner. I have still yet to see the new film but the old film has always inspired me. Meeting vintage with futuristic style.</p>
