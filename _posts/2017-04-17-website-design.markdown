# Web design projects

Hello! So these are a few of the website projects I have created. These involved using CSS3, HTML5 and jQuery.

The websites I created were done while on a front-end development course in London. 

<a href="http://kharsikar.github.io/teatime"/><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/TeaTime.jpg" class="fit image"></a>

## Tea Time

This was the first initial site I made. Got to grips with HTML5 sections, navigation function so it scrolls down the page with you, adding backgrounds images to different sections and learning how to use Google fonts.

## Scout

As above but this time also learnt how to create multiple pages and follow the same design theme through out. Learnt how to use responsive css design. Using google map plugins. Grid systems, reset css so the site works on legacy older browsers. Importance of commenting your work. Also about how to shorten CSS so it's not so heavy on page load and to keep it uniform.

## Granular

This was the fun one. Introduced to jQuery. Learnt how to implement parallax scrolling ( background moving at a slower rate to the foreground, creating a 2D effect as you scroll down the page. It creates depth to the site). Also learnt how to implement a mailchimp sign up form within the site.

Using the knowledge I learned from the websites above I went further into JQuery Here I learned how to create a rich gallery of images using a combination of CSS, HTML and jQuery. As you can see they do a fancy hover effect. Placed anchor points on the page so the navigation directly takes you to each gallery. -
